# Audio Synthesis

Several properties or parameters influence the perceived sound and contribute to the overall character and timbre of the generated audio.

## Properties that affect the perceived sound in audio

1. **Frequency**: The fundamental frequency determines the pitch of the sound. Higher frequencies correspond to higher-pitched sounds, while lower frequencies produce lower-pitched sounds.
2. **Amplitude**: The amplitude or volume of a sound determines its loudness. Higher amplitudes create louder sounds, and lower amplitudes produce softer sounds.
3. **Harmonics and Overtones**: These are additional frequencies that accompany the fundamental frequency and give each sound its unique timbre. The relative strength and distribution of harmonics and overtones significantly impact the sound's character.
4. **Attack**: The attack refers to the initial part of the sound, describing how quickly it reaches its full amplitude after being triggered.
5. **Decay**: The decay represents how the sound decreases in amplitude after the initial attack phase.
6. **Sustain**: Sustain determines the level at which the sound remains after the initial attack and decay phases.
7. **Release**: The release is the final part of the sound, defining how quickly it fades out after the sustain phase.
8. **Envelope**: The ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope is a fundamental parameter that controls the amplitude of a sound over time.
9. **Timbre**: Timbre is the quality or color of a sound, which distinguishes it from other sounds with the same pitch and volume. It is affected by the relative strength and arrangement of harmonics and overtones.
10. **Filtering**: Applying filters can modify the frequency content of a sound. Low-pass filters attenuate higher frequencies, high-pass filters attenuate lower frequencies, and band-pass filters allow only a specific frequency range to pass.
11. **Modulation**: Modulation involves dynamically altering sound properties over time. Techniques like frequency modulation (FM), amplitude modulation (AM), and ring modulation can create complex and evolving sounds.
12. **Waveform Shape**: The shape of the waveform determines the harmonic content and timbre of the sound. Common waveforms include sine, square, sawtooth, triangle, and more complex waveforms like pulse waves and wavetables.
13. **Pitch Modulation**: Techniques such as vibrato (modulation of pitch), portamento (gliding between pitches), and pitch-bend allow for expressive control over the pitch of the sound.
14. **Spatial Effects**: Adding spatial effects like panning and reverb can create a sense of direction and space in the sound.
15. **LFO (Low-Frequency Oscillator)**: LFOs are used to modulate various parameters, adding movement and animation to the sound.
